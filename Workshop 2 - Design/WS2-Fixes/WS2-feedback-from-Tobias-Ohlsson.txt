WS2 feedback from Tobias OhlssonHi,This is your result for workshop 2 in the course 1dv607. It will tell you if you have failed, need to fix or have passed. It will also give feedback. If you have failed you need to submit the Yahtzee game, if you have a fix you need to fix the issues outlined (you may also opt to do the Yahtzee game). You find deadlines at the course homepage.Workshop grade: FixWhat to Fix:1. Fix the responsibility issues in the model2. Update the class diagramFeedback:You violate the "Is A" rule for generalization/specialization, Boat is a Member, Member is a Database?! This gives a very strange design that is hard to understand (i.e. does not map to the mental model very well).This has created problems with coupling and cohesion, hidden dependencies betwen member, boat, database and the persistence.Basically Member and Boat have too much responsibility that has created a mess.You have achieved model view separation.In general avoid working so much with id's. For example in Boat contoller you have a semantic dependency to the member (asking for member pnum, adding the boat to a member etc). You have this dependency so it is better to make it clearly visible in the code. Also it is better for performance working with the objects directly instead of a lot of look ups etc.
